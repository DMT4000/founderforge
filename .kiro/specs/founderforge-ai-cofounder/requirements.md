# Requirements Document

## Introduction

FounderForge is an AI-powered virtual cofounder designed to assist entrepreneurs with strategy, funding, operations, and decision-making. This localhost edition runs entirely on a developer's local machine, eliminating cloud infrastructure dependencies while maintaining high quality through efficient, modular design. The system emphasizes simplicity, rapid setup, and performance optimization using local tools like SQLite, FAISS, LangGraph, and Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash API. Setup requires installing dependencies via pip: langgraph, faiss-cpu, sqlite3, google-generativeai (with API key stored in a local .env file).

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Context Engineering for Optimized AI Interactions

**User Story:** As a founder, I want the AI to assemble relevant context from my local data and history so that I get accurate, personalized responses without repetition.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user initiates a conversation THEN the system SHALL combine user goals, chat history from local JSON files, personal data, and guard-rails into a coherent context
2. WHEN assembling context THEN the system SHALL prioritize critical data from local text files at the context start
3. WHEN context exceeds limits THEN the system SHALL use local summarization to keep context under 16k tokens
4. WHEN processing requests THEN the system SHALL log token usage to a local file for monitoring
5. WHEN confidence falls below 80% THEN the system SHALL fallback to local interactive scripts or checklists
6. WHEN processing content THEN the system SHALL apply basic local filters using regex-based checks for toxicity and PII
7. WHEN evaluated THEN the system SHALL achieve 90% accuracy on 10 predefined test scenarios

### Requirement 2: Persistent Memory to Retain User Information

**User Story:** As a founder, I want the AI to remember my business details locally across sessions so that I don't need to repeat information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing user data THEN the system SHALL use a local SQLite database with separate short-term and long-term memory schemas per user_id
2. WHEN retrieving memory data THEN the system SHALL achieve sub-10ms access times using SQL queries on localhost
3. WHEN saving sensitive data THEN the system SHALL include confirmation prompts before storing to the local database
4. WHEN users request data deletion THEN the system SHALL provide a simple API or command-line tool for selective removal via SQL commands
5. WHEN managing data retention THEN the system SHALL implement file-based retention flags with user-controlled local scripts
6. WHEN accessing data THEN the system SHALL log all data access for privacy auditing simulation

### Requirement 3: Multi-Agent Patterns for Complex Tasks

**User Story:** As a founder, I want automated assistance with complex tasks like funding forms and daily planning so that I receive fast, accurate, and personalized guidance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing funding forms THEN the system SHALL use local Orchestrator and Validator agents with rules stored in local files
2. WHEN handling sample forms THEN the system SHALL complete processing in under 30 seconds with 95% accuracy on test data
3. WHEN executing agent workflows THEN the system SHALL log all agent steps to local files for debugging
4. WHEN generating daily action plans THEN the system SHALL chain Planner, Tool-Caller, and Coach agents using local data sources
5. WHEN providing motivational responses THEN the system SHALL integrate Gemini API for personalized coaching
6. WHEN processing parallel tasks THEN the system SHALL complete scoring and analysis in under 1 minute on localhost

### Requirement 4: Iterative Development with Two-Way Door Mindset

**User Story:** As a developer, I want rapid experimentation capabilities with easy rollback so that I can iterate quickly and safely on localhost.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making changes THEN the system SHALL tag modifications in local Git branches as T1 (one-way) or T2 (reversible)
2. WHEN configuring features THEN the system SHALL use simple config files as feature flags for quick toggles
3. WHEN assessing experiments THEN the system SHALL run weekly local evaluations with scripts to revert changes
4. WHEN tracking performance THEN the system SHALL log metrics like speed and accuracy to local files or console
5. WHEN conducting experiments THEN the system SHALL support one local experiment per week with A/B testing via script variants
6. WHEN managing workflows THEN the system SHALL use LangGraph's local checkpointing for branching and rollback

### Requirement 5: Radical Knowledge Sharing Mechanisms

**User Story:** As a team member, I want local collaborative tools for sharing prompts and ideas so that I can contribute to continuous improvement.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN managing prompts THEN the system SHALL use a local Git repository for versioning with collaborative notes
2. WHEN documenting discoveries THEN the system SHALL create weekly local notes or scripts for new tools and techniques
3. WHEN sharing resources THEN the system SHALL make all local files open by default for self-review
4. WHEN brainstorming THEN the system SHALL provide local folders or Jupyter notebooks for Q&A and idea collection
5. WHEN analyzing experiments THEN the system SHALL run monthly local teardown scripts for experiment analysis
6. WHEN encouraging innovation THEN the system SHALL implement self-feedback mechanisms to simulate psychological safety

### Requirement 6: Robust Testing and Iteration Framework

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive local testing capabilities so that I can measure performance objectively and catch issues early.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing components THEN the system SHALL use local scripts with predefined query sets for evaluation
2. WHEN measuring performance THEN the system SHALL target 90% pass rate on accuracy and latency metrics
3. WHEN running evaluations THEN the system SHALL execute fully on localhost with LangGraph integration
4. WHEN testing security THEN the system SHALL use scripts to simulate injection attacks and data leaks
5. WHEN allocating testing resources THEN the system SHALL dedicate 10% of local test cycles for security testing
6. WHEN validating readiness THEN the system SHALL require all local tests to pass before prototype completion
