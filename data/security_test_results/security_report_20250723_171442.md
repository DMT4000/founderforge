- Ensure PII detection accuracy remains above 90%
- Implement additional injection attack patterns if needed

### Medium Priority
- Review false positive patterns to reduce noise
- Enhance data leak detection for new patterns
- Add more comprehensive test cases

### Low Priority
- Optimize performance of security filters
- Add more detailed logging for security events
- Consider implementing machine learning-based detection

## Security Compliance
