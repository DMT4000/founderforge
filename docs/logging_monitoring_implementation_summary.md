## Usage Examples

### Basic Logging
```python
from src.logging_manager import log_info, log_error, log_performance, log_token_usage, log_audit

# Structured logging
log_info("component_name", "Operation completed", user_id="user123")
log_error("component_name", "Operation failed", user_id="user123", metadata={"error_code": 500})

# Performance logging
log_performance("api_endpoint", "user_query", 1.5, True, user_id="user123")

# Token usage logging
log_token_usage("user123", "chat_completion", 150, 75, 225, cost_estimate=0.01)

# Audit logging
log_audit("user123", "data_access", "user_profile", True, ip_address="127.0.0.1")
```

### Performance Monitoring
```python
from src.performance_monitor import record_response_time, record_accuracy, record_error_rate

# Record metrics
record_response_time("api_endpoint", 1.2)
record_accuracy("ai_model", 0.95)
record_error_rate("service", 0.02)
```

### System Initialization
```python
from src.system_integration import initialize_system, get_system_status, shutdown_system

# Initialize complete system
initialize_system(log_dir="data/logs", log_level=LogLevel.INFO)

# Get system status
status = get_system_status()
print(f"System status: {status['status']} - {status['message']}")

# Graceful shutdown
shutdown_system()
```
